combinAna
=========

The goal of combinAna is to provide functions for identifying the functional structure of interactive systems, then to record and plot all useful results. CombinAna is composed of only few functions, that can produce a large number of graphs managed by a set of options. The package is therefore easy to use.

Installation
------------

You can install the released version of combinAna from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("combinAna")
```

Scientific issue
----------------

We define a system as a collection of elements gathered in a finite space, which interact with each other. The elements are of any kind, and their interactions too. But the interactions between elements are at the origin of emergent functioning or properties specific to the system. The question is to relate the elemental composition of the system to its functioning or property. This relation will allow to predict the functioning or property of the system knowing its element composition.

``` r
install.packages("combinAna")
```

Example
-------

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
