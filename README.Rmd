# combinAna

The goal of combinAna is to provide functions for identifying the functional 
structure of interactive systems, then to record and plot all useful results. 
CombinAna is composed of only few functions, that can produce a large number 
of graphs managed by a set of options. The package is therefore easy to use.

## Installation

You can install the released version of combinAna from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("combinAna")
```

## Scientific issue

We define a system as a collection of elements gathered in a finite space,
which interact with each other. The elements are of any kind, and their 
interactions too. But the interactions between elements are at the 
origin of emergent functioning or properties specific to the system.
The question is to relate the elemental composition of the system 
to its functioning or property. This relation will allow to predict
the functioning or property of the system knowing its element composition.


``` r
install.packages("combinAna")
```



## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can 
include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` 
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, 
so they display on GitHub!
